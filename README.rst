Oculy: Modular data viewer
==========================

Installation
------------

Currently Oculy cannot be installed directly due to one of its dependency not
being available on PyPI. To install it directly from GitHub, you can::

    pip install git+https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/glaze
    pip install git+https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/oculy

Once installed Oculy can be started by either running::

    oculy

or::

    python -m  oculy

The second option allow you to see the program console output and can be useful to debug issues.
